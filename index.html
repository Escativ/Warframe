            <p class="box1cont2">
                <br>Warframe is a free-to-play loter shooter action game, where you will loose your mind to the ever growing grind that will never end, only escape being your demise or the inevitable end of the universe... <br>
                <br>Developed and published by Digital Extremes. It was first released in 2013 and is available on multiple platforms, including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. In the game, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves at war with various factions across the solar system. <br>
                <br>The primary feature of Warframe is the use of "Warframes". These "Warframes" are your playable characters with different sets of abilities and looks (Lore included). Players can participate in co-op missions, such as exterminating enemies, sabotaging enemies, being racist against enemies. <br>
                <br>Warframe is known for it's ASSets, or it's grind, or for it's mass genocide against the enemy, or parkour. <br>
